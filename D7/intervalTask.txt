Easy Level
1. Print Message Repeatedly

Write a program that prints "Learning JavaScript" every 2 seconds.

2. Simple Counter

Use setInterval to print numbers from 1 to 10 every 1 second, then stop automatically.

3. Digital Clock (Console)

Display the current time every second in the console using new Date().

Medium Level
4. Stop Interval After Some Time

Create an interval that prints "Running..." every second and stops after 5 seconds using clearInterval.

5. Countdown Timer

Create a countdown from 10 to 0 every second.
When it reaches 0, print "Time’s Up!" and stop.

6. Change Background Color

In a webpage:

Change the background color every 2 seconds.

Stop changing after 10 seconds.

7. Blinking Text

Make a text element appear and disappear every 500ms.

Hard Level
8. Progress Bar Simulation

Create a progress bar that:

Increases by 10% every second

Stops at 100%

Displays “Completed”.

9. Multiple Intervals Control

Create two intervals:

One prints "A" every second.

Another prints "B" every 2 seconds.
Stop both after 8 seconds.

10. Auto-Save Feature Simulation

Simulate an auto-save feature:

Print "Saved" every 3 seconds.

If user presses a button (or triggers a function), stop the interval.

11. Typing Effect

Display a string like "Hello World" one letter at a time every 300ms using setInterval.

12. API Polling Simulation

Create an interval that:

Calls a fake function fetchData() every 5 seconds

Stops after 3 calls

Challenge (Advanced Thinking)
13. Replace setInterval with setTimeout

Re-implement Question 5 (Countdown Timer) without using setInterval, only setTimeout.

14. Memory Leak Scenario

Create an interval inside a button click handler.
Then fix the issue so multiple clicks don’t create multiple intervals.
