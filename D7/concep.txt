setInterval is a built-in JavaScript timing function used to run a piece of code repeatedly after a fixed time interval.
Basic Definition

setInterval executes a function again and again with a specified delay between each execution.
Syntax
setInterval(function, delay, arg1, arg2, ...)
Parameters

function – The code or function you want to run repeatedly.

delay – Time in milliseconds (1000 ms = 1 second).

arg1, arg2… – Optional arguments passed to the function.
Simple Example
setInterval(() => {
  console.log("Hello Ganesh!");
}, 1000);
What happens here:

The message prints every 1 second.

It never stops unless you clear it.
Return Value

setInterval returns an Interval ID (a number).

You use this ID to stop the interval.

const id = setInterval(() => {
  console.log("Running...");
}, 2000);

Stopping setInterval

Use clearInterval() with the interval ID.

const id = setInterval(() => {
  console.log("Hello");
}, 1000);

setTimeout(() => {
  clearInterval(id);
}, 5000);


Result:
Runs every second → stops after 5 seconds.

Real-World Use Cases

Progress bars

How It Works Internally (Event Loop)

JavaScript calls setInterval.

Browser schedules the function in Web API Timer Queue.

After delay → moved to Callback Queue.

Event Loop pushes it into Call Stack when stack is empty.

Executes repeatedly.

Difference: setInterval vs setTimeout
Feature	setInterval	setTimeout
Runs	Repeatedly	Once
Stop	clearInterval	clearTimeout
Use Case	Continuous tasks	Delayed task
Passing Arguments
function greet(name) {
  console.log("Hello " + name);
}

setInterval(greet, 1000, "Ganesh");

Common Mistakes
1. Forgetting clearInterval

Leads to memory leaks or performance issues.

2. Using Too Small Delay
setInterval(fn, 1); // Bad


Can freeze browser or overload CPU.

3. Overlapping Execution

If the function takes longer than the delay, calls may stack.

Advanced Pattern (Better Alternative Sometimes)

Instead of setInterval, use recursive setTimeout:

function repeat() {
  console.log("Running...");
  setTimeout(repeat, 1000);
}
repeat();


Why better?

Prevents overlapping.

Gives more control.

Key Points to Remember

Time is in milliseconds.

Returns an ID.

Must use clearInterval to stop.

Can cause performance issues if misused.

Runs on Event Loop, not blocking main thread.

In Short

setInterval = Run this code every X milliseconds until I say stop.
