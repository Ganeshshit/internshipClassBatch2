Task 1 – Delayed Greeting

Create a function greetUser(name) that:

Waits 2 seconds

Then prints: Hello <name>

If name is empty → print Invalid Name immediately (without timeout)

Concepts: condition + setTimeout
Task 2 – Countdown Timer

Write a program that prints:

5
4
3
2
1
Go!


Rules:

Each number should appear after 1 second

Use loop + setTimeout

Do NOT use setInterval


Task 3 – Delayed Array Processing

Given:

const numbers = [2,4,6,8];


Task:

After 3 seconds, print the sum of array

If array is empty → print "No Data"

Concepts: array + reduce + timeout



Task 4 – Fake Login System

Create a function login(username, password):

Behavior:

Immediately print "Checking credentials..."

After 2 seconds:

If username = "admin" AND password = "1234" → "Login Success"

Else → "Login Failed"

Concepts: condition + timeout + logical operators


4. Filter Array + Async

Array: [10, 25, 30, 45, 60]

Tasks:

Create a function that filters numbers greater than 30

Use setTimeout to return result after 2 seconds

Print "No numbers found" if empty.

. Student Pass/Fail

Array of marks [40, 55, 70, 20]

Write a function that checks each mark

If ≥ 35 → "Pass"

Else → "Fail"

Display result one by one every second using setTimeout.
7. Async Fetch Simulation

Create a fake async function getUsers():

Returns array of users after 2 seconds.

Loop through users.

If age > 18 → "Adult"

Else → "Minor"

8. Shopping Cart Logic

Array of prices [100, 250, 75, 300]

Tasks:

Create async function calculateTotal

Use setTimeout

If total > 500 → "Discount Applied"

Else → "No Discount"
9. Sequential Delays

Array: ["A","B","C","D"]

Tasks:

Print each letter with 1-second gap.

Use function + setTimeout.

If letter is "C" → print "Special Letter".
